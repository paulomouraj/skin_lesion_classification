# Classification of Skin Lesions

## Description
The goal of this work was to perform supervised classification of skin lesions to 8 diagnostic classes. This project is part of [Télécom Paris Image Processing](https://www.telecom-paris.fr/fr/ingenieur/formation/2e-annee-orientation/image) course and its goal was to apply classical machine learning and deep learning methods to classify medical images in a highly umbalanced dataset.

## Dataset
The skin lesion images along with metadata were taken from ISIC dataset, available on https://challenge.isic-archive.com/data/.
